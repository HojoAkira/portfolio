            Clean Code: Why It’s More Than Just a Best Practice
          </h2>
          <p class="post-excerpt">
            <strong>Beyond “it works”:</strong> Many developers think
            functionality alone is enough, but messy code slows teams down. As
            Bob Martin says: <q>The only way to go fast, is to go well.</q>
          </p>
          <p class="post-excerpt">
            <strong>Readability = productivity:</strong> Clean code is easy to
            understand, even for someone who didn’t write it. This reduces
            onboarding time and prevents errors.
          </p>

          <p class="post-excerpt">
            <strong>Maintainability:</strong> Projects evolve. Clean code allows
            developers to extend features or fix bugs without breaking existing
            functionality.
          </p>

          <p class="post-excerpt">
            <strong>Collaboration:</strong> Teams thrive when code is consistent
            and clear. It avoids “knowledge silos” where only one person
            understands a messy module.
          </p>
